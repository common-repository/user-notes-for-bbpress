Let moderators apply notes to individual users on your bbPress forums.

== Description ==
Some times adding a note to users is needed for other moderators to be familiar with events for future references.

You may wish to let your fellow moderators know why a user is flagged, or perhaps to let another moderator know that this users has prior permissions to post content that may land in a grey area and have various responses to.

After activation, a `Toggle user notes` link will be available to moderators under the author information on every post, this will expand the existing notes for a user, and provide a field for adding new notes.

When a note is added, all moderators can see the note, who added it and when. The timestamp link also provides a link to the post the note was added from to give an indication of why the note is there.
